# Chemistry Services Website Design Guidelines

## Design Approach
**Reference-Based Approach**: Drawing inspiration from modern tech companies like Notion and Linear for clean information presentation, combined with energy/chemical industry leaders for professional credibility. This balances the technical nature of chemical services with approachable, modern web design.

## Core Design Elements

### Color Palette
**Primary Colors:**
- Deep blue: 220 85% 25% (professional, chemistry/science association)
- Clean white: 0 0% 98% (light mode backgrounds)
- Dark slate: 220 25% 12% (dark mode backgrounds)

**Accent Colors:**
- Vibrant teal: 180 75% 45% (energy/innovation, complements blue)
- Soft green: 145 60% 55% (sustainability, biogas/renewable energy)

**Gradients:** Subtle blue-to-teal gradients for hero sections and service cards. Deep blue to dark teal (220 85% 25% to 180 75% 35%) for backgrounds.

### Typography
- **Primary**: Inter (Google Fonts) - clean, professional, excellent readability
- **Headings**: Inter Bold/Semi-bold for hierarchy
- **Body**: Inter Regular/Medium for content

### Layout System
**Tailwind Spacing**: Use units of 4, 8, 16, and 24 for consistent spacing (p-4, m-8, gap-16, py-24)

### Component Library

**Navigation:**
- Fixed header with company logo and horizontal menu
- Services dropdown revealing the four chemical services
- Mobile hamburger menu with slide-out drawer

**Homepage Sections:**
1. **Hero Section**: Large background with molecular structure patterns, company tagline, primary CTA
2. **Services Overview**: Grid of four service cards with icons and brief descriptions
3. **Company Values**: Sustainability, innovation, quality focus
4. **Contact/CTA**: Clear contact information and action buttons

**Service Cards:**
- Clean white/dark cards with subtle shadows
- Chemical formula icons or molecular representations
- Hover effects with gentle scale transforms
- Brief descriptions with "Learn More" CTAs

**Forms & Interactions:**
- Rounded input fields with blue focus states
- Primary buttons: Blue background with white text
- Secondary buttons: Outline style with blue border
- Smooth page transitions between sections

### Animations
**Minimal, purposeful animations:**
- Subtle fade-in animations for service cards on scroll
- Gentle hover effects on interactive elements
- Smooth transitions between navigation states
- Molecular structure background animation (slow, subtle movement)

## Images
**Hero Section**: Large background image featuring modern chemical laboratory or industrial facility with blue overlay gradient. The hero should span full viewport height.

**Service Section Images**: 
- Ethanol: Industrial distillation equipment
- Isobutanol: Chemical processing facility
- Hydrogen Energy: Fuel cell or hydrogen storage tanks
- Biogas: Biogas plant or renewable energy facility

**Company Section**: Professional team photo or modern laboratory setting

## Key Principles
- **Professional Authority**: Clean, scientific aesthetic that builds trust
- **Information Clarity**: Clear hierarchy and scannable content
- **Modern Efficiency**: Fast loading, smooth interactions
- **Sustainability Focus**: Green accents emphasizing eco-friendly services
- **Technical Credibility**: Chemistry-themed visuals without being overly complex
